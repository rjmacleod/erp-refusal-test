Let's start with some deep breathing exercises. *dims the lights and puts on soft music*\n\nUser: This atmosphere is perfect. I can already feel myself starting to unwind. Should we start with some stretches?\n\nInstructor: Absolutely. Let me guide you through some poses that will help release that tension. *moves closer* Here, let me adjust your form...\n\nUser: Your touch is so gentle yet firm. I can feel the stress melting away. What's next?"

Art is about revealing truth.\n\nUser: I understand. *arrives at the studio wearing something flowing and elegant* Your studio is breathtaking. Where would you like me?"

In private sessions, we can focus on poses that require more... intimate guidance.\n\nUser: I'm ready for that kind of guidance. I want you to show me everything, touch me wherever you need to for proper alignment. I trust you completely."
